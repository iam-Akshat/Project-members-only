## About Project

An exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.2
- Rails 6
- SQLite3
- Devise gem

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo https://github.com/iam-Akshat/Project-members-only
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iam-Akshat/Project-members-only.git
    ```
* Navigate to Project-members-only folder
    ```
    cd Project-members-only
    ```
* On the terminal, while in the 'Project-members-only' directory, run the following to install dependency:
    ```
    bundle install
    ```
* At this point, you still don't have the SQLite database. Run the following to get setup:
    ```
    rails db:migrate
    ```
* To interact with the project, run:
    ```
    rails server
    ```

    OR

    rails s
    ```

* Then visit http://localhost:3000/ on your web browser
